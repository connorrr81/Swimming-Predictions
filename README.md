# Swimming-Predictions
To what extent can competitive swimming results be predicted? I aim to use various machine learning techniques to predict the 2020 Olympic swimming results given data on historical swims. I'm doing this for a bit of fun, plus I haven't seen a tool online that does data-driven predictions. Growing up as a competitive swimmer I had already spent hours and hours trawling through swimming data, so I knew the data for swimming results are out there. Now I'm building on my data science toolkit, I just had to give it a go. 

## Data Source
The data was obtained from swimrankings (https://www.swimrankings.net/index.php?page=home) which holds a database containing (most) results from elite-level competitions all over the world. Their data is based on information from the European Swimming Federation (LEN) rankings database and the results and ranking database of national swimming federations.
